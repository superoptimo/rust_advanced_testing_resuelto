# Quaking like `cargo test`

As you have seen in the previous exercise, there are no requirements on your test
entrypoint beyond... _existing_.\
You can execute arbitrary logic, print in whatever format, etc.\
The only thing that `cargo test` cares about is the exit code of your test executable,
which must be `0` if all tests passed, and `1` otherwise.

## Integration brings benefits

Your test harness might be custom, but it's still being invoked via `cargo test`.\
As a CLI command, `cargo test` exposes quite a few knobs: you can list tests, filter them,
control the number of threads used to run them, etc.

All those features become **demands** on your custom test harness: are you going to
honor them? Or are you going to ignore them?

The latter is less work, but the resulting behaviour will surprise your user.
If I run `cargo test <test_name>`, I expect only `<test_name>` to be run, not all tests.\
But if your custom test harness ignores CLI arguments, that's exactly what will happen.

The same applies when interacting with other toolsâ€”e.g. CI systems. If your test
report format is not compatible with `cargo test`'s, you'll have to write a custom
adapter to make it work.

## `libtest_mimic`

Matching `cargo test`'s behaviour is a lot of work.\
Luckily, you don't have to do it yourself: [`libtest_mimic`](https://docs.rs/libtest-mimic)
can take over most of the heavy lifting.

It provides an [`Arguments`](https://docs.rs/libtest-mimic/latest/libtest_mimic/struct.Arguments.html)
struct that can be used to parse `cargo test`'s CLI arguments.\
`Arguments` is one of the two inputs to their [`run`](https://docs.rs/libtest-mimic/latest/libtest_mimic/fn.run.html)
function, the other being all the tests in your test suite.
`run` interprets the parsed arguments and runs the tests accordingly (e.g. listing them,
filtering them, etc.). It's a testing framework, so to speak.
