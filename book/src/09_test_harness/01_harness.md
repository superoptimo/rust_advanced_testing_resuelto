# Custom test harness

## Test targets

In your past projects you might have had to set properties for your binary (`[[bin]]`)
and library (`[lib]`) targets in your `Cargo.toml`.\
You can do the same for your **test targets**!

```toml
[[test]]
name = "integration"
```

The configuration above declares the existence of a test target named `integration`.\
By default, `cargo` expects to find it in `tests/integration.rs`. You can also customize
the path to the test entrypoint using the `path` property.

You don't often see `[[test]]` targets in the wild because `cargo` infers them automaticallyâ€”i.e.
if you have a `tests/integration.rs` file, it will automatically be compiled and run as an integration test.

When you see a `[[test]]` target in a `Cargo.toml`, it's usually because the author wants to disable
the **default test harness**:

```toml
[[test]]
name = "integration"
# ðŸ‘‡ That's enabled by default
harness = false
```

## Test harness

The **test harness** is the code that `cargo` invokes to run your tests.

When `harness` is set to `true`, `cargo` automatically creates an entrypoint (i.e. a `main` function)
for your test executable using [`libtest`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/test),
the default test harness.

When `harness` is set to `false`, `cargo` expects you to provide your own entrypoint.

## Pros and cons

With a custom test harness, you are in charge!\
You can execute logic before and after running your tests, you can customise how each test
is run (e.g. running them in separate processes), etc.

At the same time, you need to provide an entrypoint that integrates well with `cargo test`'s
CLI interface. Listing, filtering, etc. are all features that you'll need to add support for,
they don't come for free.
