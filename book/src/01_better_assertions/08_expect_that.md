# `expect_that!`

All your `googletest` tests so far have used the `assert_that!` macro.\
If the assertion fails, it panics and the test fails immediately. No code after the assertion is executed.

## `expect_that!`

`googletest` provides another macro, called `expect_that!`.\
It uses the same matchers as `assert_that!`, but **it doesn't panic if the test fails**.\
When the test ends (either because the entire test function has been executed or because it later
panicked), `googletest`
will check if any `expect_that!` assertions failed and report them as test failures.

This allows you to write tests that check multiple things and report all the failures at once.\
A good use case is verifying multiple properties on the same object.
