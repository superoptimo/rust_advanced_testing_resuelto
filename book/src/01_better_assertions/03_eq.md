# Basic matchers

To truly leverage a testing library like `googletest` you need to get familiar with their built-in matchers.
They're the building blocks of your assertions and they need to roll off your fingers as easily as `assert_eq!` does.

We'll spend this exercise and a few more to get familiar with the most common matchers, starting with the most basic
ones.

> Tooling helps: coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Cody will start suggesting the right matchers as you type
> if you've already used them in a few tests in the same project.
