# Outro

Refactoring to an interface is a key technique that should be in the toolbox of every developer.\
Automocking, on the other hand, should be evaluated on a case by case basis: a mock-heavy testing approach
often leads to high-maintenance test suites.\
Nonetheless, it's important to play with it at least once, so that you can make an informed decision.
That was the primary goal of this section!

## What's next?

The next three sections will zoom on three different types of external dependencies:
the filesystem, databases and HTTP APIs.\
We'll look at a few techniques to perform full(er)-fidelity testing when the code under test interacts with this kind
of systems.
