# Outro

`wiremock` is an example of _transferable knowledge_: once you've learned how to use a mocking library (e.g. `mockall`)
you can apply the same patterns to any other library in the same category.\
You just need to learn the specifics of the new domain (HTTP, in this case), but the general approach remains the same.

## Onwards

You are done with full-fidelity testing techniques.\
In the next section, you'll take matters into your own hands. You'll be building your own test runners and custom
test macros!
