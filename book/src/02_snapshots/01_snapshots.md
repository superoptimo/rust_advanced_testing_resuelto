# Your first snapshots

## `insta` macros

To work with snapshots, we need to use `insta`'s assertion macros.\
There's one macro for each format we want to compare:

- `assert_snapshot!` for strings
- `assert_debug_snapshot!` to compare the `Debug` representation of a value with a snapshot
- `assert_display_snapshot!` to compare the `Display` representation of a value with a snapshot
- `assert_json_snapshot!` to compare JSON values
- etc. for other formats (check the [documentation](https://docs.rs/insta/) for a complete list)

You always want to use the most specific macro available, since it will give you better error messages thanks
to the more specific comparison logic.

## `insta` review

The key command exposed by `insta`'s CLI is `cargo insta review`.\
It will compare the snapshots generated by your last test run with the ones you had previously saved.
